# CubeSat-Simulation
Physics-based CubeSat simulation integrating two-body orbital propagation, quaternion attitude dynamics, PD control, atmospheric drag, and stochastic sensor modeling. Validates orbital conservation and drag-induced decay while analyzing attitude stability and measurement error statistics using numerical integration and visualization.
